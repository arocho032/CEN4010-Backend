// * A Façade object that acts as the interface for the SOS 
// * Storage subsystem. The other subsystems interact with 
// * the database through a preset set of actions defined in 
// * the SOS Data Store Façade. A façade is a structural design 
// * pattern which is used to provide a unified interface to a 
// * set of objects within a subsystem. Even though our data store 
// * is a single object, a façade is still warranted because the 
// * SOS Data Store is implemented using a database component (SQL) 
// * and through the SOS Data Store Façade we can decouple the 
// * details of the database component (such as the SQL language) 
// * from the rest of the system.
